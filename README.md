As a developer, I was asked by Kasa, France's leading private flat rental company, to revamp their website.
For this task, I used JavaScript for the client side and opted for React as the framework for the front end. I had access to 20 recent property listings in JSON format, which I worked on to create a functional and responsive website.
I also used Figma to convert the mock-ups into React components and routes, which enabled me to ensure visual consistency while developing an interactive and user-friendly interface.
